Win Vista/7/8/10/11 Note by JMD:
	Universal Media Disc Stream Composer (the USC exe) has to be renamed to something other than the default. Here it's called PSP Stream Composer. The program is fully portable.
	DirectShow error on load can be ignored. The error is just for the preview pane.
	By this point you should already have finalised and separated audio/video streams, and that we only need this program to mux/merge and output to MPS,
	Not to actually edit video with (because program is now 17+ years old in 2022, use something better like Vegas or Premiere).

from ikskoks's MediEvil PSP modding tutorial:

PMF to AVI Tools:
- mplayer - http://mplayerwin.sourceforge.net/downloads.html (included in bin, cli)
- mencoder - part of above
- vgm toolbox - https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/ (included in bin, has GUI)
- virtualdub (included in bin, has GUI, not to be confused with VirtualDubMOD)

AVI to PMF Tools:
- PSP Stream Composer (included in bin, has GUI)
- MPStoPMF (included in bin, cli)
- PmfCreator (included in bin, has GUI)

After you collect all tools, you can start conversion.

PMF to AVI conversion:
1. Run Windows command-line (cmd.exe).
2. Execute cd <mplayer_folder>
3. Execute mplayer -dumpvideo <pmf_file_path>
4. Execute mencoder.exe stream.dump -ovc raw -noskip -ofps 29.97 -o done.avi
5. Extract OMA Audio from PMF file using vgm toolbox
6. Convert OMA to WAV. You can do it here https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav or here https://www.filezigzag.com/
7. Use virtualdub to merge audio and video to AVI file.
8. [optionally] Use AVI ReComp to add subtitles to AVI and decrease file size.

AVI to PMF conversion:
1. Run Umd Stream Composer
2. Create new project in Umd Stream Composer. Remember to check option "PSP Movie".
3. Drag your AVI and WAV files to Umd Stream Composer window.
4. Compile MPS file in Umd Stream Composer using option "Encode+Multiplex".
5. Create PMF using MPStoPMF or PmfCreator tools.

After you convert all movies to PMF, you can simply replace them in a movie folder GAMENAME\PSP_GAME\USRDIR\movies or GAMENAME\PSP_GAME\ICON1.PMF (144x80 res) for animated XMB icons.

PSLover14's joined guide from "Converting Guide.txt" in the MPS to PMF Converter Zip:

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here we go, a Tutorial.
Most of this is from Converting Guide.txt in the MPS to PMF Converter Zip.
First, Find a AVI of a Video you want to make into a pmf. I used www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAhvQoLpvsM
which is a PSX Boot.
Next Download AviSynth at HERE (included in bin, installer, open source)
Then Download VirtualDubMOD at HERE (included in bin, has GUI)
Just in case nobody has clicked on them yet, they are both on SourceForge.
Make sure if your video is a DivX Encoded video, you have DivX Codec, NOT K-Lite Codec Pack as The PSX Boot vid I encoded it into a DivX, and VirtualDubMod can't read it without the OFFICIAL DivX Codec.
Now google Sony Umd Stream Composer. I can't tell you where to download it. (substituted with 'PSP Stream Composer' from here on)
Then click HERE to go to a PSPMOD page and click Download on the MPS to PMF converters. (included in bin)

This is the part, straight from Converting Guide.txt
Install AviSynth 1st.
Now extract VirtualDubMod to a folder.
Find the file you want to convert. Once found, open up notepad.
Type the following lines in the text document.

-----------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS FOR AN ICON
copy everything between the blank lines below into a new doc
-----------------------------------------------------------

DirectShowSource("YOURVIDEOFILEHERE.EXTENSION")
lanczosresize(144,80)
changefps(29.97)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Replace YOURVIDEOFILEHERE.EXTENSION with the name of the file you want to convert including its extension.

For example, I want to make a Gameboot,

-----------------------------------------------------------

DirectShowSource("naruto.avi")
lanczosresize(480,272)
changefps(29.97)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Now save your text document in the same folder as your movie file.

Make sure you save it as an .AVS file and not a .TXT file.

This is done by changing "Save as type" to "All Files" and adding the extension the the filename you are going to save it as, eg, NARUTO.AVS.

Now locate the folder you extracted virtualdubmod to. open VirtualDubMod.exe

Go to File>Open File. Find your .AVS file. Open that. you should now see your video file in the window.

Now go to Streams>Stream List.

Click Save WAV. After it is saved click disable. Now go to OK.

Now go to File>Save As. name your avi file and click save.

Almost there now. :) Last step!

Find your WAV file you saved. Open it with sound recorder. Go to File>Save As.

Where it says Format at the bottom of the save window, click on Change.

Format should be: PCM
Atrributes: 44.100 kHz, 16 Bit, Stereo 172kb/sec.

Click ok. Now save your WAV as a new name.

Sony UMD Tools
1: Open up the PSP Stream composer.exe
2: Go to new
3: Name it what you want. Click next
4: Tick the PSP Movie format (for game) bit.
5: Change the max clip size to 2mb or less
6: Hit finish
7: Go to video source
8: Find your video file made earlier with Virtual Dub Mod
9: Go to audio source
10: Find the WAV you made earlier.
11: Now go to run at the top
12: Choose encode + multiplex
13: Hit start
14: Well done the .mps has been made

Step 4, .mps to .pmf Converter
1: Go to My Documents (well yours)
2: Go to the PSP Stream composer folder
3: The .mps file is in here somewhere (I forget where exactly!)
4: Put it in the same directory as the Icon1 or Gameboot converter
5: Run the converter (Click Gameboot Converter or Icon Converter)
6: And your gameboot pmf's or icon1 pmf's should be created.

This only works with Windows, as far as I know.
Thanks
