.. index:: Summary

Summary
=======

This is a command line python program to search keywords/key-phrases on Google Images
and optionally download images to your computer. You can also invoke this script from
another python file.

This is a small and ready-to-run program. No dependencies are required to be installed
if you would only want to download up to 100 images per keyword. If you would want **more than 100
images** per keyword, then you would need to install ``Selenium`` library along with ``chromedriver``.

   Google Images is a search engine that merely indexes images and allows you to find them.
   It does NOT produce its own images and, as such, it doesn't own copyright on any of them.
   The original creators of the images own the copyrights.
